Social pressure often influences many choices we make. Using data from the paper "Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment" by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008), specifically from Michigan in 2006, we want to inform strategies for increasing votes in the current Texas gubernatorial election. A potential weakness in our model is the that data from Michigan in 2006 will not be the best to represent Texas nowadays.
